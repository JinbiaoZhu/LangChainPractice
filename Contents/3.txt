There is a word deeply rooted in the hearts of the teachers and students of the Major Railway Rock Burst Technology Research Group, and that is "responsibility". The tunnel geology is complex, and the risk of rock bursts is extremely high. Rock burst monitoring and early warning are the "eyes" of engineering safety construction. When young teacher Zhang Wei learned that he was going to participate in the major railway project, he was excited: "When I think of this dream that spans two centuries, carrying the expectations of several generations of Chinese people for a major project, I feel extremely honored. With this sense of responsibility, even if we encounter difficult problems, we can overcome all obstacles and forge ahead."

Every year during the Spring Festival, the research group arranges key members to stay at the construction site to ensure continuous safe construction and prevent delays in project progress due to rock bursts, thus minimizing the cost of project construction.

Currently, the average accuracy rate of rock burst early warning by the Major Railway Rock Burst Technology Research Group of Northeastern University has exceeded 85%, receiving widespread praise from all walks of life. Feng Xiating said: "In the future, we will actively respond to General Secretary Xi Jinping's call to 'march into the depths of the earth', continue to face difficulties, take the lead, face the world's scientific frontiers, face the main battlefield of the economy, face the major needs of the country, and further advance towards solving the world problem of rock burst time warning, striving to achieve rock burst time warning in a shorter time range and contribute to the early opening of the major railway.
