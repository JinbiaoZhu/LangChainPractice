PhD student Fu Hongyuan from the class of 2022 felt psychological pressure when he arrived on the plateau. His master's research was focused on coal mines, but he was now working on a railway project. Quickly switching research fields in an unfamiliar and harsh environment was a big challenge for him. His supervisor, He Benguo, communicated with Fu Hongyuan in a timely manner, understood his living and research situation, and provided targeted guidance.

Fu Hongyuan's experience is a typical example of the "passing down" tradition of the rock burst technology research group. Every day, the group holds two fixed meetings to report and discuss. In the morning, they focus on safety, while in the evening they plan and arrange work for the next day. The teachers also guide the students on their research progress for the day. If they encounter a special rock burst on that day, the group will conduct more detailed analysis and discussion, study the characteristics and mechanisms of the rock burst, actively explore and discover problems, and fill in gaps to prepare for subsequent work.

"Fulfilling academic research on the land of our motherland." Feng Xiating constantly instills this concept into young teachers through his own actions. Hu Lei, a young teacher, said: "Feng requires us to discover and solve problems from the construction site, apply theoretical achievements to the site, find shortcomings from application, optimize, practice and improve."

Group members pay special attention to communication and coordination with the project construction team. Jin Zhaotong, a master's student from the class of 2021, said: "The construction team has rich practical experience, and we communicate with on-site workers frequently. This can further improve rock burst monitoring and warning work, which is equivalent to installing a 'stethoscope' for rock bursts in tunnels."
